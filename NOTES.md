### Oral feedback

Good decision 
Good breakdown
Good Commit on each green test
Good naming of methods (score) relevant name, for implement that could use (gereratorReport)

Start with concrete test, non very important testing type of function on instance of 
    becose are implicit in the second test - Good point for save as much time as possible

Working trough arrays, kata ed exercise in general. (how filter element and how count element)

Think and develop edge cases at the end, so you can focus on main logic

Follow the process every moment end let tests guide you even when you are trying to implement the logic
or refactoring

## Mains area
* Focus on the criterias and really understand them 
* Follow the TDD process and the " Test, Red error, Green solution " process
* Play and training with arrays
